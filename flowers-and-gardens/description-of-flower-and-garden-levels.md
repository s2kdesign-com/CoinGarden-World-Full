# Description of flower and garden levels ðŸ§¾

### In the beginning, the user starts by just uploading pictures of flowers.

With each watering, its flowers will develop and new photos may be added.

When a user uploads a new photo of the same flower, it automatically becomes one level up, so another user can buy the entire growth cycle of a very rare plant in nature.

The same rule applies when uploading additional photos of entire gardens. Each subsequent photo will increase the level of both the garden and all the flowers contained in the photo.
